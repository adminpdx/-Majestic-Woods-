area of 740 square feet, which square footage can be on one or two levels, but must 
be above grade. If the Lot is improved with a basement or crawl space, such area is 
not to be included in the required minimum living area.

Each Lot may be improved with a garage, attached or unattached to the dwelling. However, 
in no case shall the area of the garage count toward tire required minimum living area 
of 740 square feet.

buildings of a temporary nature shall remain on the lot other than during the time of 
construction.

substantially and primarily constructed on the site.

wood, stucco, stone, brick, vinyl, steel siding or any other commonly used 
exterior surface. James Hardy or Certainteed materials are acceptable as 
long as they are of the wood grain variety. Exterior colors must be earth 
tones.

including front, rear and side yard setback requirements, and all other pertinent 
ordinances, rules and regulations of the Town of Eau Galle, County of Dunn and State of 
Wisconsin. This provision shall apply to all Lots and Units in that the setbacks for each Lot or 
Unit shall be controlled by relevant, current zoning ordinances.



TREE AND BRUSH REMOVAL

Declarant emphasizes their commitment to maintaining the natural beauty and privacy of 
the Lots / Units and the property as a whole. Maintenance and preservation of existing 
trees and vegetation is the primary way this is accomplished. Removal of only the 
minimum amount of vegetation and foliage is encouraged. No part of this section may be 
altered, revised, or otherwise eliminated at any time in the future, even by unanimous 
vote of the Association.

1. Compliance with any and all existing Township, County, State and/or DNR regulations or 
ordinances as they pertain to the preservation or removal of trees and vegetation is 
required and takes precedence over any provisions set forth below.

2. The Owner may remove trees and vegetation for purposes of construction of their home, 
garage/storage building, and driveway. Beyond said needs, there shall be no tree or brush 
removal within fifteen (15) feet of any Lot / Unit line, unless said removal falls within 
the view corridor outlined below or said removal is approved by Declarant or the 
Association.

3. The owner of a Lot / Unit which borders Lake Eau Galle may, within the thirty (30) foot 
wide view corridor (being the width one can cut and trim trees and brush between the 
principal dwelling structure and the lakeshore), remove ONLY those trees that have a 
circumference at their widest point of sixteen (16) inches or less (approximately five 
inches in diameter) and may trim only those branches that have a circumference at their 
widest point of thirteen (13) inches or less (approximately four inches in diameter).
Note: Circumference takes precedence over diameter in determining compliance with this 
Declaration.

4. Owner may request of Declarant specific exceptions to these restrictions. After the 
owner of a Lot / Unit has completed removal within the above guidelines, Owner can 
request a tour of property with Declarant and indicate their desire with respect to any 
additional tree or vegetation removal. The request may be made of the Association after 
all Lots / Units have been sold by Declarant Declarant (or the Association, as the case 
may be) shall record in the office of the Dunn County Register of Deeds its approval of 
any removal requests that are granted, and only after this pre-approval is given and 
recorded may the removal occur.

5. Due to the irreversible consequences of tree and branch removal, the Owner agrees to 
pay an assessment of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for every circumference inch (or 
part thereof) of tree or branch removal that exceeds the cutting limitations set forth in K3 
above, takes place outside of the view corridor or is otherwise unauthorized by Declarant 
(or the Association in the event that the Declarant has sold all Lots / Units in the 
Subdivision). With respect to trees or branches that are of a circumference of thirty (30) 
inches or more, the assessment shall increase to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per 
circumference inch. The assessment due hereunder shall be immediately due and 
payable upon the unauthorized tree or branch removal and without any further action on 
the part of the Declarant or Association. The assessment shall immediately and without 
any further action or notice whatsoever become a lien against the Lot / Unit upon which 
the tree or branch removal occurred. Measurement of circumference shall be made at 
the ground level with respect to trees, and at the point at which the branch connects to 
the trunk with respect to branches. The assessment shall be paid to the Nature 
Conservancy by the Association after deducting any costs of collection. The owner of the 
Lot / Unit shall be responsible for all attorney's fees and the cost of collection with 
respect to any such assessment and these costs shall be added to and become part of the 
assessment lien. Note: the assessment for unauthorized cutting outside the view corridor 
shall be based upon the total circumference inches of each branch or tree removed, as 
the case may be. 

LIMITATIONS ON TREE REMOVAL ON ENTIRETY OF LOT

The concept of a "view corridor (as mentioned in III, I, 3 on page 5 of the original 
Covenant document) does not apply to the Lots specified in Section II of the 
Amendment For those Lots specified in Section II, a Lot owner is only permitted to 
remove trees for purposes of construction of their home and attached deck and/or patio, 
a garage or storage building, driveway, and septic system. The additional following 
guidelines apply:

• No more than twenty (20) feet of vegetation may be removed for the width of a 
driveway

• Only the vegetation required to be removed for a septic system may be removed 

• Except for the driveway and septic system, no tree with a circumference greater 
than fifteen (15) inches measured at its widest point may be removed outside a 
distance of forty (40) feet from the footprint of a dwelling, garage or detached 
shed or storage building. This provision does not encourage the removal of trees 
within this forty (40) foot area; it merely stipulates an outer perimeter. Trees 
should be removed within Ulis forty foot area only if absolutely necessary.

• Under no circumstances shall a tree be removed for any purposes, even as a 
result of construction, within twenty (20) feet of any Lot line shared with another 
Lot of Majestic Woods South.


SIGNS AND UTILITIES.

With the exception of signs such as "Welcome to Our Family's Cabin", or signs displaying 
the name of Owner, no Owner of a Lot I Unit shall post any permanent signs upon said 
Lot  I Unit, and no signs advertising an Owner's business or trade activity shall ever be 
posted or erected. Temporary political signs may be posted as long as they are 
displayed only during an active campaign, are limited to one per candidate and do not 
exceed six (6) square feet in area. One sign of not more than six square feet in area 
advertising the property for sale is permitted. For Sale signs shall not be posted on the 
property by any parties other than Legacy Land Group until all parcels are sold within the 
Subdivision unless express written consent of the Declarant is obtained. All utilities shall 
be placed underground. No satellite dishes over 24 inches in diameter are allowed.


EXTERIOR LIGHTING.

No owner shall construct or display any type of permanent lighting outside of their 
buildings except for simple incandescent bulbs which serve to illuminate the doors to said 
buildings or to illuminate a deck or walkway. Such exterior lights must be attached to a 
building. Exterior lights may not be left on overnight; they must be motion activated if 
used after 10 pm. All exterior lighting shall be hooded or shaded so that all exterior 
lighting is directed at or below a horizontal line which intersects the source (bulb element) 
of exterior lighting.



SEPTIC SYSTEMS

Each Lot/Unit owner shall individually decide how to address the septic requirements 
of any dwelling they choose to build and shall be responsible for the cost of any planning, 
installation, inspection, maintenance, operation or repair required for each lot’s or unit’s 
individual septic requirements. Lot/Unit owners may elect to join with other Lot/Unit owners
to plan, install and maintain a responsible for installation of a common sanitary system. The 
decision and expense will be solely the responsibility of the Lot/Unit owners. If installed, 
the costs of such installation, maintenance and repair shall be shared equally by all 
Lot/Unit owners access the common sanitary system. 

In no case will the Association or the Declarant be responsible for installation of septic 
service to any lot or unit.
