I. TREE AND BRUSH REMOVAL

Declarant emphasizes their commitment to maintaining the natural beauty and privacy of 
the Lots / Units and the property as a whole. Maintenance and preservation of existing 
trees and vegetation is the primary way this is accomplished. Removal of only the 
minimum amount of vegetation and foliage is encouraged. No part of this section may be 
altered, revised, or otherwise eliminated at any time in the future, even by unanimous 
vote of the Association.

1. Compliance with any and all existing Township, County, State and/or DNR regulations or 
ordinances as they pertain to the preservation or removal of trees and vegetation is 
required and takes precedence over any provisions set forth below.

2. The Owner may remove trees and vegetation for purposes of construction of their home, 
garage/storage building, and driveway. Beyond said needs, there shall be no tree or brush 
removal within fifteen (15) feet of any Lot / Unit line, unless said removal falls within 
the view corridor outlined below or said removal is approved by Declarant or the 
Association.

3. The owner of a Lot / Unit which borders Lake Eau Galle may, within the thirty (30) foot 
wide view corridor (being the width one can cut and trim trees and brush between the 
principal dwelling structure and the lakeshore), remove ONLY those trees that have a 
circumference at their widest point of sixteen (16) inches or less (approximately five 
inches in diameter) and may trim only those branches that have a circumference at their 
widest point of thirteen (13) inches or less (approximately four inches in diameter).
Note: Circumference takes precedence over diameter in determining compliance with this 
Declaration.

4. Owner may request of Declarant specific exceptions to these restrictions. After the 
owner of a Lot / Unit has completed removal within the above guidelines, Owner can 
request a tour of property with Declarant and indicate their desire with respect to any 
additional tree or vegetation removal. The request may be made of the Association after 
all Lots / Units have been sold by Declarant Declarant (or the Association, as the case 
may be) shall record in the office of the Dunn County Register of Deeds its approval of 
any removal requests that are granted, and only after this pre-approval is given and 
recorded may the removal occur.

5. Due to the irreversible consequences of tree and branch removal, the Owner agrees to 
pay an assessment of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for every circumference inch (or 
part thereof) of tree or branch removal that exceeds the cutting limitations set forth in K3 
above, takes place outside of the view corridor or is otherwise unauthorized by Declarant 
(or the Association in the event that the Declarant has sold all Lots / Units in the 
Subdivision). With respect to trees or branches that are of a circumference of thirty (30) 
inches or more, the assessment shall increase to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per 
circumference inch. The assessment due hereunder shall be immediately due and 
payable upon the unauthorized tree or branch removal and without any further action on 
the part of the Declarant or Association. The assessment shall immediately and without 
any further action or notice whatsoever become a lien against the Lot / Unit upon which 
the tree or branch removal occurred. Measurement of circumference shall be made at 
the ground level with respect to trees, and at the point at which the branch connects to 
the trunk with respect to branches. The assessment shall be paid to the Nature 
Conservancy by the Association after deducting any costs of collection. The owner of the 
Lot / Unit shall be responsible for all attorney's fees and the cost of collection with 
respect to any such assessment and these costs shall be added to and become part of the 
assessment lien. Note: the assessment for unauthorized cutting outside the view corridor 
shall be based upon the total circumference inches of each branch or tree removed, as 
the case may be. 


J. SIGNS AND UTILITIES.

With the exception of signs such as "Welcome to Our Family's Cabin", or signs displaying 
the name of Owner, no Owner of a Lot I Unit shall post any permanent signs upon said 
Lot  I Unit, and no signs advertising an Owner's business or trade activity shall ever be 
posted or erected. Temporary political signs may be posted as long as they are 
displayed only during an active campaign, are limited to one per candidate and do not 
exceed six (6) square feet in area. One sign of not more than six square feet in area

Subdivision unless express written consent of the Declarant is obtained. All utilities shall 
be placed underground. No satellite dishes over 24 inches in diameter are allowed.


K. EXTERIOR LIGHTING.

buildings except for simple incandescent bulbs which serve to illuminate the doors to said 
buildings or to illuminate a deck or walkway. Such exterior lights must be attached to a 
building. Exterior lights may not be left on overnight; they must be motion activated if 
used after 10 pm. All exterior lighting shall be hooded or shaded so that all exterior 
lighting is directed at or below a horizontal line which intersects the source (bulb element) 
of exterior lighting.


L. OFFENSIVE ACTIVITY

There shall be no piling or burning of trash on said premises, nor noxious or offensive 
trade activity conducted. No activity shall be done thereon which may be or may become 
an annoyance or nuisance to other owners within the Subdivision. The Subdivision is 
intended to bestow upon the members of the Association a feeling of retreat and privacy. 
Therefore, no loud music or similar noise, or parties, may be permitted on any Lot / Unit 
which interferes with any other Lot / Unit owner, Lot / Unit occupant or neighbor’s 
enjoyment of their premises. No music or other amplified sound may be played in such 
manner such that it is audible to a person with normal range of hearing beyond the Lot / 
Unit line of the Lot / Unit from which the sound emanates.

therein or thereon, in good order and repair and free of debris, all in a manner as is 
consistent with good property management. Where a Lot / Unit owner fails to maintain 
his/her Lot / Unit, the Declarant or Association may, upon three (3) days advance notice 
to the Lot / Unit owner, undertake the maintenance necessary to restore the premises to 
good order and repair, or free of debris, and the cost thereof shall be immediately 
assessed against the Lot / Unit without any further notice or proceeding whatsoever.


P. EROSION CONTROL & RAIN GARDENS.

Lots One (1) through Fourteen (14) of the Subdivision and Units Two (2) through Nine (9) 
in the Condominium Plat are required to construct a rain garden to assist in the collection 
of rainwater runoff from the driveway, house, and any other outbuilding. The exact 
nature of the rain garden required will depend upon the length of the driveway and the 
size and placement of buildings. The rain gardens shall be constructed in accordance 
with with design specifications as modified, from time to time, in two DNR publications found 
at the following web site: HTTP://clean-water.uwex.edu/pubs/raingarden/

In the event such site no longer exists then the last such publications on that site shall be 
deemed incorporated herein by reference and shall constitute the standards in 
accordance with which the rain gardens must be constructed.

The buyer of Lot Eleven (11) shall have two years from date of purchase to install a rain 
garden system around the existing house in accordance with the forgoing standards.
Within the view corridor and on any other part of Owner's Lot / Unit, Owner Is encouraged 
to plant vegetation and engage in any other prudent steps to minimize erosion.



IV. MAINTENANCE & UTILITIES

A. SHARED MAINTENANCE OF THE ROAD.

All Owners of Lots / Units in the Subdivision and the Condominium Plat (with the 
exception of Lot Forty One (41) whose owner will not use the private road) shall share 
equally in the right to use and in the obligation to maintain and repair the road. Any 
expense, other than contracted snow removal and grading, which is in excess of one 
hundred dollars ($100) per Lot / Unit per calendar year must be expressly agreed upon 
by at least a two-thirds majority vote of all members. Each Lot / Unit is entitled to one 
vote as set forth at paragraph 5D.

B. SHARED MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AREAS.

The ditches and pond areas constructed along the road and in oilier designated areas of 
the Subdivision and Condominium Plat, including the swale and dry pond area lying north 
of the Subdivision, which exist for the purpose of managing the runoff of stormwater 
within the Subdivision in an environmentally satisfactory manner, shall be maintained as 
directed and required by the Department of Natural Resources and/or the board of 
directors of the Association or Declarant (as long as Declarant owns any Lots / Units in 
the Subdivision). The DNR requires that these ponds be inspected semi-annually and 
maintained in a manner which ensures their adequate performance fortheir intended 
purpose. Declarant shall be responsible for the initial construction of the ponds and the 
associated ditches, as well as initially contracting for such maintenance and 
improvement. After Declarant no longer owns any Lots I Units in the Subdivision or the 
Condominium Plat, the Association shall be responsible for continuing to contract for the 
inspection, maintenance and improvement of same. The Association shall assume all 
liability for failure to keep the ditches and ponds in good working order. The costs 
associated therewith (except initial construction) shall be paid by the Association. To the 
extent necessary the Association may levy an assessment against the members to obtain 
necessary funds to perform inspection, maintenance and improvements. The 
assessments shall be levied in equal shares against all members, i.e., all owners of Lots / 
Units. This maintenance obligation is one which shall run with the land and be binding 
upon the owners of, and appurtenant to, the Lots / Units. This paragraph may not be 
changed or modified to lessen the maintenance obligation, even by unanimous vote.

C. COMMUNITY SEPTIC SYSTEM.

Lots One (1) through Fourteen (14) in the Subdivision and Units Two (2) through Nine (9) 
of the Condominium Plat shall have access to and the right to use a Community Septic 
System (CSS). The CSS shall be constructed at Declarant’s expense. The conveyances 
of said Lots and Units shall be subject to an easement twenty-five (25) feet in width, for 
purpose of construction, installation, repair, and maintenance of the sewer mains referred 
to herein. In addition, the conveyances of Lots Fifteen (15) and Nineteen (19) shall be 
subject to an easement for purposes of construction, installation, repair and maintenance of 
the drain field for the CSS. At the time of the execution of this Declaration it has not yet 
been determined by the design engineer of the CSS precisely where the sewer mains 
and drain fields shall be placed. It is intended the mains shall follow the portion of the 
private road running approximately parallel to Lake Eau Galle from Unit Nine (9) in the 
South, Northerly and Northwesterly to a cul-de-sac terminating at Lot Fourteen (14). At 
such time as the sewer mains have been laid the Declarant shall file an amendment to 
these By-Laws, better defining the location of the easement described in this paragraph 
and that description shall become the permanent description of said sewer main 
easement.

1. Declarant shall be responsible for constructing and installing the CSS in good, working 
order. Thereafter, each Lot / Unit owner having access to the CSS shall be responsible to 
share in the cost of any inspection, maintenance, operation, or repair activities required of 
the CSS after its initial construction. All costs and fees associated therewith shall be 
shared equally by the owners of Lots / Units which can be served by such system. 
Though no owner of a Lot / Unit shall be required to use the CSS, the owner of a Lot / 
Unit which has access to the CSS shall share in the cost of inspection, maintenance, 
operation, and repair. Each Lot / Unit owner's responsibility to share in such expense 
shall be determined by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Lots / 
Units owned by that owner and the denominator of which shall be the total number of 
Lots / Units which can be served by the system.

2. The Association shall be responsible for arranging the necessary inspection, 
maintenance and repair of the CSS. The Association may form a special committee to 
address these issues composed solely of those Lots and Units served by the CSS.

3. Each Lot/Unit owner is responsible for the cost of connection of their dwelling to the 
Community Septic System. The Declarant shall charge a hook-up assessment of 
$7,500.00 to each Lot / Unit which has access to the CSS. This charge shall be fully due 
and payable to Declarant by the owner of each Lot / Unit on the date their residence 
connects to the CSS, or May 1, 2008, whichever is earlier. No interest shall be charged 
with respect to this assessment. In (he event any such hook-up assessment is not 
paid within the time frame aforementioned, Declarant may elect to direct Ure Association 
to levy an assessment against the Lot / Unit for the balance due for such hook-up 
assessment, together with any costs and fees as may be incurred by Declarant and/or 
the Association. The Association shall be required to impose the assessment lien 
against the Lot / Unit. All amounts collected shall be paid to Declarant; except, however, 
the Association may also collect against the Lot / Unit those reasonable charges incurred 
by the Association in the collection of the assessment hook-up charge. The assessment 
hook-up charge shall be deemed automatically made and levied against, and therefore 
automatically attaches, to the Lot / Unit if the payment is not timely made without any 
further official action by the Association. The Secretary/Treasurer of the Association is 
authorized to issue a release or waiver of this hook-up assessment charge after the 
expiration of the applicable aforesaid two year period provided Declarant has furnished 
said Secretary/Treasurer, in writing, a statement that the hook-up assessment for the Lot 
/ Unit has been fully paid. Any such waiver shall be executed by the Association in 
recordable form. 


D. ELECTRIC UTILITY SERVICE

Electric utility service shall be installed in the Subdivision and Condominium by 
Declarant. It shall be installed in conjunction with construction of the road. The electrical 
service shall be underground and shall lie within the boundaries of the road or the utility 
easement shown on the Subdivision plat and Condominium plat.



V. MISCELLANEOUS

A. SCHOOL BUS PROVISION.

As the roads in the Subdivision and Condominium are private and there is no easily 
accessible turnaround for a school bus, Lot and Unit owners are hereby advised that
